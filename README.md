## News and Announcements
* [2024-09] EgoSurgery-Phase and EgoSurgery-Tool are now available. Thank you for your patience.
* [2024-05] Our paper EgoSurgery-Phase is accepted to MICCAI 2024! (early acceptance within the top 11%)

## ðŸ’¡ Overview
We introduce EgoSurgery, an egocentric surgical video dataset and benchmark. Our goal is to provide training and benchmarking data for research in egocentric surgical video understanding.

## ðŸ“š Dataset
### EgoSurgery-Phase (MICCAI 2024) [[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19644)
EgoSurgery-Phase is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition.
